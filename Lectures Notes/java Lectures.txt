Day1 Java training
Step1: JDK Install from google
 Drive c< Program files< Java<bin -> Copy the path
 Right click on this PC< Properties< search for environment< Path variable<edit<new<paste the copy

Day2
*File name should be PascalCase.e.g., FirstClass
*Java is based on OOPs.
*Everything is done by using objects.
*Every program in java starts with a class.
*Every class has some features.
*File name and class name should be same.
*Should include comments to make understand easily.
*Source code (.java)
*Compile(javac).
*javac<SourceFileName>.java
*We'll get byte code(.class).
*To open terminal to get source code compile (ctrl+`).
*Compile--> File Name but on Compile byte code will be make by class name.
*To run--> java<BytecodeName>(Class Name).
*Main method or main functon--> Entry Point or Entry gate.
*void -->keyword(Reserve Word)- No return.
*static --> when class is loaded in memory, then static will load along.
*Static (Eager Loading).
*public - access outside the package(Folder).
*String args[] --> Command Line Arguments.
*args is flexible, means that we can change its name to different one.
*In Terminal -->cls to clear the terminal
*print is a predefined function whose function is to print on console.
*out object belongs to PrintStream Class and created by System Class.
*[]--> Box / Array.


Day3
Data Types
* Numeric-> Byte(-128 to 127 (-2^(8-1) to 2^(8-1)-1)), short, int, long
* Text
* Boolean


Day4
Access modifier
1. Public
2. Private
3. Protected
4. Default

System class
1. System.in --> for input
   Input
    --> Keyboard using scanner class
    --> Files
    --> Network
2. System.out --> for output
3. System.err --> for error

For input
System.in.read --> Reads one char at a time and return ASCII Value of char read.

datatypes
1. Primitive
byte      float      boolean     char
short     double
int         
long
2. Non-Primitive
-string--> belongs to wrapper class, wrapper class also contains integer, float, char, double, long.
-Array

Day5
Conditions and loops
Scanner is a predefined API(a predefined class)

Day6
Loops and conditional statements
* create constants by using keyword final with capital alphabets. Always declare constants in capital case.
* SonarQube SoanrCloud ---> a software used to review code.(whether it is readible or not).
* variable name or functions name is always in camel case.
* class name is always in pascal case.
* constants is always in capital case.
*Formatted and unformatted ---> 2000- unformatted
   Rs.2,000-> formatted
* objects can be make either shared or personal.
* In heap, META SPACE memory has been created by JRE,JRE activates JVM, JVM activates classloader and memory will create in heap where all classes will load in META SPACE.
* After classloading, java will check BYTE Code Verification whether there is any malicious code or not.
If not, then interpret the code and convert into native code.
* object is in heap, local variables and functions is in stack.
*Visual vm ---> a tool which will tell and show memory and heap and stack as well.


Day7
loops
* To solve a problem, there are 2 ways
   1. Iterative way --> Looping
   2. Recursion -->Repetition

Operations used in loops
1. a++
2. ++a
3. a--
4. --a
